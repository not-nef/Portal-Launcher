    <h1>Portal Launcher</h1>
</p>

I am a huge fan of the portal franchise and lots of its mods. And i play a lot of them. And recently i thought that i dont want all of those icons on my desktop, and a program to acces all of them would be way cooler. So i made it, and i upload it here for other portal fans to use it!

## Warning!:

The app is currently in Beta phase ans so many features are still missing! If you find bugs, PLEASE report them on the issues page!

## Features:

Currently the app can only launch the games you see on the screenshot, and you have to specify the game ids for the sourcemods (Portal: Prelude and Portal 2 Speedrun Mod) at the first launch until i find a way to automatically detect them. (Help wanted!!)

### Planned Features:

There is just way too many so i wont list them here.
